# Microsoft-Malware-Detection--Kaggle

This dataset has been taken from https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction. Feel free to visit this link and gain knowledge and read others solutions also.

## Problem Statement


In the past few years, the malware industry has grown very rapidly that, the syndicates invest heavily in technologies to evade traditional protection, forcing the anti-malware groups/communities to build more robust softwares to detect and terminate these attacks. The major part of protecting a computer system from a malware attack is to identify whether a given piece of file/software is a malware.

## About Data

Microsoft has been very active in building anti-malware products over the years and it runs itâ€™s anti-malware utilities over 150 million computers around the world. This generates tens of millions of daily data points to be analyzed as potential malware. In order to be effective in analyzing and classifying such large amounts of data, we need to be able to group them into groups and identify their respective families. <br/>

This dataset provided by Microsoft contains about 9 classes of malware. <br/>

There are total 10,868 .bytes files and 10,868 asm files total 21,736 files <br/>
There are 9 types of malwares (9 classes) in our give data <br/>
Types of Malware: <br/>
1. Ramnit<br/>
2. Lollipop<br/>
3. Kelihos_ver3<br/>
4. Vundo<br/>
5. Simda<br/>
6. Tracur<br/>
7. Kelihos_ver1<br/>
8. Obfuscator.ACY<br/>
9. Gatak<br/>

## Business Objective And Constraints

1. Minimize multi-class error. <br/>
2. Multi-class probability estimates. <br/>
3. Malware detection should not take hours and block the user's computer. It should fininsh in a few seconds or a minute. <br/>
4. Minimize multi-class log loss <br/>
5. Probabilistic model. <br/>
6. Low latency requirement. <br/>
